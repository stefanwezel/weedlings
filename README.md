The model WeedNet classifies different weeds and crops. Different kinds of weeds have high impact on the yield of an acre or field.

A model that classifies different kinds of plants, that can occure on such an environment could be used to fight them in a ecologically safer way. So far this repository is still a WIP but feel free to contribute...
